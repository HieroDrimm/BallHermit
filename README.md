# BallHermit
## About project
This game was made as proof for myself that I can make a game from start to finish using Unity.
Despite its simplicity it had its challenges. The whole development process lasted a month.
## Running
You can download compiled and ready-to-run app from Google Play Store [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RuneForge.Hermit), but for IOS you will have to clone rep and compile yourself.
Unity Version is 2020.3.7f1
